Updates:

- removed previous way of interaction    
- redid terrain generation (works)    
- redid player-terrain interaction (skeleton there, doesnâ€™t really work)    
- tried to fix jump, getting complicated    

Need to do:    
- sprites    
- level    
- mob paths    
- mob and player HP    
- music    
- polishing    

Notes:    
- might want to fix boolean values in my playerinteraction function or make it return a string to make it easier to understand    

5/26/15    
Updates:    
- continued on player-terrain interaction    
- tried to fix going through the floor, much better than before    

Need to do:    
- sprites    
- level    
- mob paths    
- mob and player HP    
- music    
- polishing    

Notes:    
- want to redo the way terrain works, currently lags because I generate a terrain item every .5 of a coord

- Added terrain class    
- Removed movement in up and down

5/22/15 (Initial Setup)
Roadmap of goals:    
- Basic movement (left and right)    
- Jumping    
- Enemies+life implementation    
- Hitboxes    
- Attacks    
- Map structure    
- Boss/possible mini-boss    
- Sprites    
- Music    
- More levels    
- Polishing hitboxes and sprites    

What will be challenging:    
- movement and sprites, maybe the jumping depending on implementation(holding spacebar makes you jump higher or a set jump)    

What are the minimum features for a working project:    
Movement, enemies, attacking, interactions between sprites (hitboxes)    


Brief Description:    
We will be creating a platform game similar to Megaman. The player uses a character to maneuver across a map while killing enemies by using projectiles or a sword. There is going to be a boss at the end of the stage.
