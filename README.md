5/22/15 (Initial Setup)
Roadmap of goals:    
- Basic movement (left and right)    
- Jumping    
- Enemies+life implementation    
- Hitboxes    
- Attacks    
- Map structure    
- Boss/possible mini-boss    
- Sprites    
- Music    
- More levels    
- Polishing hitboxes and sprites    

What will be challenging:    
- movement and sprites, maybe the jumping depending on implementation(holding spacebar makes you jump higher or a set jump)    

What are the minimum features for a working project:    
Movement, enemies, attacking, interactions between sprites (hitboxes)    


Brief Description:    
We will be creating a platform game similar to Megaman. The player uses a character to maneuver across a map while killing enemies by using projectiles or a sword. There is going to be a boss at the end of the stage.
